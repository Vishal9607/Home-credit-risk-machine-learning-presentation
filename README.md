# Introduction

This project addresses the default risk in BFSI institutions by developing a credit scoring mechanism using applicant and bureau data. We build a classification model to predict loan defaults, leveraging both bureau and internal bank data. Key steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and validation using Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier, and Light Gradient Boosting to improve loan approval decisions.
